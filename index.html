            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
                An awesome fps-rts game created by some inexperienced high-school dudes. Right now, run and shoot each other. And by "each other", I mean some white pills that don't resemble any life form whatsoever. There are four awesome maps currently, with more on the way. Chatting is being implemented so you can tell the other players how big of scubs they are.</p> 
            
            <p>Us four are slaving away, making this game so you better love it. I'm serious. We will never talk to you again if you dislike it.</p>
            
            <p>NOW WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, SCRUB?!?! GO PLAY IT. NOW.</p>

            <h4>To Be Implemented</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the pill-people feature (sorry!)</li>
                <li>MOAR GUNZ!</li>
                <li>Variable fire rates for guns</li>
                <li>Scopes for guns</li>
                <li>Mini-map/radar thing</li>
                <li>Make shells come out of the side of the gun instead of out of the barrel!</li>
                <li>Remove infinite ammo feature (hurry and write a script to spam 'r' and 'left click' while you can!)</li>
                <li>The other half of the game, and what is said in the title: RTS elements!</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Controls</h4>
            <p>I hope you at least know the standard FPS controls... because right now there is nothing special. If you don't, you don't deserve to play our amazing game.
